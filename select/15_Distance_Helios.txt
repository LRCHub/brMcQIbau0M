You come stand in line
And over here, come get my kiss
And I'll be clear:

I need some distance
I want the distance, some distance
Is there someone else on your mind
When your lips press up on mine
I taste the difference
Now I need some distance, some distance

Why pretend everything's ok
I'll put my time in
And this will never be safe
Will never be the same girl I was when
Calling you Chris
Tonight, I'm fine, your goodbye
Cause you really don't wanna go
Here tonight, I won't cry,
But you never listen though

You come stand in line
And over here, come get my kiss
And I'll be clear:
I need some distance
I want the distance, some distance
Is there someone else on your mind
When your lips press up on mine
I taste the difference
Now I need some distance, some distance

Who knows who to blame
Should've brought us close
The ones ... you say you love the most
I am a once, and you will get it twice
It's for the best, and now it's turning fast

Tonight, I'm fine, your goodbye
Cause you really don't wanna go
Here tonight, I won't cry,
But you never listen though

You come stand in line
And over here, come get my kiss
And I'll be clear:
I need some distance
I want the distance, some distance
Is there someone else on your mind
When your lips press up on mine
I taste the difference
Now I need some distance, some distance

All I wanna feel is distance between us
All I wanna feel is distance between us
All I wanna feel is distance between us
All I wanna feel is distance between us
